<h4>Welcome to our new styleguide.</h4>

<p>The purpose of SugarCRM Multiverse Styleguide is to provide a baseline design language to MFE projects. MFE projects then can inherit CSS rulesets of various layouts and components. Multiverse Styleguide does not define code structures or naming conventions making it possible to easily inherit look and feel of base SugarCRM by any framework.</p>
